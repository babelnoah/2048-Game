# 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 Game repository! This is a Java-based version of the popular sliding block puzzle game, 2048. I created this game as my first computer science project in my freshman year for AP Computer Science A. 

## Features

- Classic 2048 gameplay
- Smooth animation
- Score tracking
- Neat and simple UI

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this game, make sure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

## Installation and Running the Game

To play the 2048 Game, you need to have Java installed on your computer. Once you have Java set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/babelnoah/2048-Game.git
   cd 2048-Game
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac Game.java
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   java Game
   ```

## How to Play

After running the game, use the arrow keys to slide the tiles across the grid. Combine tiles with the same number to add them up, aiming to reach the 2048 tile!

- **Up Arrow**: Move tiles up
- **Down Arrow**: Move tiles down
- **Left Arrow**: Move tiles left
- **Right Arrow**: Move tiles right

The game ends when you either create a 2048 tile or when you run out of moves with no more possible combinations left.
